## Game Play Thoughts
* People visit the main game URL and asks to play the game
* After everyone is ready, the game begins
* A long flat world is created
* User can scroll the world right/left
* User owns a collection (like 5) tanks
* User can select which tank has focus
* User can control the tank that has focus
